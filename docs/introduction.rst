============
Introduction
============

dotgit allows you to easily store all your dotfiles for any number of machines
in a single git repository. Written in python with no external dependencies
besides git, it works on both Linux and MacOS (should also work on other \*nix
environments)

Project Goals
=============

* Share files between machines or keep separate versions, all in the same repo
* Make use of an intuitive filelist
* Grouping of files to make organization easy
* Make git source-control convenient and easy to use
